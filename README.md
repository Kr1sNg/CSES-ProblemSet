# [CSES - Problem Set Solution](https://cses.fi/user/343981)
Solution for CSES Problem Set ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡®

## Introduction - Code Submission Evaluation System
The [CSES Problem Set](https://cses.fi/problemset/) is a collection of algorithmic programming problems.

The goal of the project is to create a comprehensive high quality problem set for learning algorithmic programming. The current collection has 400 problems, and new problems will be gradually added.

## Languages
You can solve problems in several languages, including C++, Java, and Python. More information about available languages is [here](https://cses.fi/howto/).

## Input and output
In all problems you should read input from standard input and write output to standard output.

## Hacking
After solving a problem, you can view the solutions by other users and try to hack them by giving a test case where the solution fails. Then, the new test case can be added to the test data and all submissions will be regraded.

## Books
You can use the problem set together with recent competitive programming books, listed [here](https://cses.fi/book/index.php). The books discuss techniques and ideas that are useful when solving the problems.

## License
The license of the problem set is Creative Commons BY-NC-SA 4.0.
